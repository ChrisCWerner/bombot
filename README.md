# BomboT

## About

This is a personal project to create a "humane" bot for BombCrypto.

## Ok, so what?

My goal is to achieve the following checklist:

- [x] Detect active Bombcrypto windows & sizes (Windows only for now, Linux-based systems on the near future);
- [ ] Auto-enter game/auto metamask;
- [ ] Auto gameplay;
  - Smooth mouse moves & clicks in area instead of mouse warps & pixel clicks;
- [ ] Auto detect game error & auto game re-enter;
- [ ] Detect map state to better use heroes;
- [ ] Messaging service to alert game state & coins in chest.

Feel free to add any suggestion in discussion.
